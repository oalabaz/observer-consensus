# 👁️ Observer Consensus

**A decentralized, reputation-based protocol for ethical decision-making in autonomous AI systems. Powered by Aye Coin.**

---

## 🌐 Overview

Observer Consensus is a layered protocol designed to allow AI agents (like self-driving cars, drones, and smart systems) to make fair, transparent, and verifiable decisions in real-time—while being observed, scored, and improved by a decentralized mesh of other agents and humans.

## 🪩 Aye Coin

- Native token powering the ecosystem.
- Used for staking proposals, rewarding observers, and voting in Oracle Protocol.
- Also used for in-house distribution of rewards based on local reputation via the Conscious Recall Layer.
- Deployed on **Arbitrum**.

---

## 🚀 Live Features (MVP Goals)

- Observer-based visual home page with 3D eye interactions.
- Wallet connection with reputation tracking.
- Aye Coin purchase via Uniswap (Arbitrum).
- Proposal & voting logic (Oracle Protocol).
- Reputation & reward redistribution.

## 🧠 Core Layers (Organized from Core to External Needs)

- **Layer 0:** Observer Awareness (the foundation of self-recognition and accountability)
- **Layer 5:** Conscious Recall Layer (pattern recognition & behavioral memory, for in-house local reputation scoring and Aye Coin distribution – not for Oracle submission)
- **Layer 1:** Sensorium (environmental truth perception)
- **Layer 2:** Interpretation (understanding context and intent)
- **Layer 3:** Decision (choosing fair, consensus-aligned actions)
- **Layer X:** Courage / Last Move (ethical override in extreme cases)
- **Layer 4:** Commonwealth & Suggestions (contributing improvements to the system)
