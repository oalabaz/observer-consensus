# 👁️ Observer Consensus

**A decentralized, reputation-based protocol for ethical decision-making in autonomous AI systems. Powered by Aye Coin.**

---

## 🌐 Overview

Observer Consensus is a layered protocol designed to allow AI agents (like self-driving cars, drones, and smart systems) to make fair, transparent, and verifiable decisions in real-time—while being observed, scored, and improved by a decentralized mesh of other agents and humans.
